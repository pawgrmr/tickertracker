# A Sleeping Respiratory Rate tracker for dogs with Cardiac issues. 

##Why should I use this app?
To monitor the sleeping respiratory rate and signs of heart disease in your pet dog or cat.
##What is a Sleeping Respiratory Rate?
Monitoring the sleeping respiratory rate is a useful tool in assessing whether your dog or cat is showing signs of heart disease (congestive heart failure).
To measure the sleeping heart rate make sure your pet is in a comfortable environment (not too hot/cold). Your dog needs to be asleep (i.e. not dreaming). A full breath in and out is counted as a single breath.

There are a lot of different types of heart disease in pet dogs and cats most common being degenerative heart disease which can lead to chronic heart failure. You can find more information [here](http://cprvictoria.com.au/disease-explanations.html).
