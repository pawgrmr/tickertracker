		<h3>Why should I use this app?</h3>
			<p>To monitor the sleeping respiratory rate and signs of heart disease in your pet dog or cat.</p>
		<h3>What is a Sleeping Respiratory Rate?</h3>
			<p>Monitoring the sleeping respiratory rate is a useful tool in assessing whether your dog or cat is showing signs of heart disease (congestive heart failure).</p>
			<p>To measure the sleeping heart rate make sure your pet is in a comfortable environment (not too hot/cold). Your dog needs to be asleep (i.e. not dreaming). A full breath in and out is counted as a single breath.</p>
			<p>Normal sleeping respiratory rate: < 30 breaths per minute.</p>
		<h3>What is Heart Disease and how does it affect my pet?</h3>
			<p>There are a lot of different types of heart disease in pet dogs and cats most common being degenerative heart disease which can lead to chronic heart failure. You can find more information <a href="http://cprvictoria.com.au/disease-explanations.html">here.</a> </p>
